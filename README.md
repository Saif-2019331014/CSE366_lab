# CSE366 (Communication Engineering lab) tasks

1. Determine the minimum hamming distance in a set of codewords.
2. Determine the even parity codeword of a dataword. Highlight the parity added. Determine if a codeword is corrupted using parity checking.
3. Determine the CRC codeword for a given dataword and divisor. Determine if the codeword is corrupted using CRC checker.
4. Determine the Checksum codeword for a list of five 8-bit numbers.
5. Draw the signals for NRZ-L, NRZ-I and Pseudoternary line coding schemes.
